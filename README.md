### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

I have figured out how to make only one button active using previousElementSibling and nextElementSibling by removing 'circle-active' from each element's classList when the new target button is selected.
```js
if (e.target.checked) {
            btn.classList.add('circle-active');
            if (btn.previousElementSibling !== null) {
                btn.previousElementSibling.classList.remove('circle-active');
  .....
} if (btn.nextElementSibling !== null) {
              btn.nextElementSibling.classList.remove('circle-active');
```


### Continued development

Continue to improve my skills on JavaScript and learning frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.
